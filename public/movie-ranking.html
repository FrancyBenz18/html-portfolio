<ol>
    <li><h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
        <p>It's majestic, epic, romantic and dramatic all at the same time, while having a huge cast with incredible acting, an incredible score and so much emotion, closing in the perfect way the best trilogy in recent movie history.</p></li>
    <li><h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
        <p>Just experience it, an amazing story of drama, resilience and comeuppance, a must watch for everyone.</p></li>
    <li><h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
        <p>The special tale of a special dude just making his way through life. Feels guaranteed.</p></li>
